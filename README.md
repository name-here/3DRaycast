# 3DRaytrace
The goal of this project is to create a 3D raytracer that can render various objects with reflections, refraction, and shadows.  In other words, it should be able to generate an image of a scene containing a variety of objects made of "materials" with different properties.  Unfortunately, most of these goals have not yet been achieved.

### Progress
Currently, the program is able to render flat shaded and reflected spheres and planes with simplified direct lighting.  Unfortunately, all planes are restricted to being aligned with one of the three axes.  A TODO list with features to add, bugs to fix, and things to finish can be found in "[TODO.md](http://github.com/name-here/3DRaytrace/blob/master/TODO.md)".  

### Problems Solved
- Finding intersection between a ray and planes or spheres
- Calculating surface normals, and calculating a reflected ray based on that normal
- 

### Notes
- Currently, there may be bugs if there are more objects loaded than the max int value, as each object has an ID, which is stored as an int.

### Compiling

#### Linux
To compile for linux, simply ```cd``` into directory containing the project files and run ```make```.  This will create the executable "3DRaytrace".  To start the program, just run the executable with ```./3DRaytrace```.

Note: You must have the development version of SDL2(download [here](http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)) installed to compile the program, and either the development or runtime version installed to run it.

#### Mac OS
For Mac OS, compile using the Xcode project in the App folder.

#### Windows
I have not tested compiling for Windows yet, so you're on your own.
