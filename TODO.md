# 3DRaytrace TODO List(s)

### To Do:

<!-- - classes.cpp line 182: add position to ball shadow casting(??) -->
- Find the normal of a triangle when it is created
- Finish triangle.cast
- Make triangle.cast work for shadows
- Make shadows more realistic (add indirect lighting, integrate into normal cast)
- Optimize getting rays for camera (maybe don't use sine/cosine)
- Solve Camera funcs(see start of draw()) not working without another func after it
- Make used CRay(s) not part of main file (maybe put into Camera class)
- Optimize operator== on points if possible
- Optimize various functions in objects.cpp (cast functions) to use -=, +=, etc.
- Have all variables set by the object hit by the ray be set only for that object instead of being set by each successive object until it gets to the right one.
- Go through code and trim out unnecessary variables and stuff
- Make lists in World object private and create some other way of changing the properties of objects in them (add functions should return pointer/id)
- Find way of updating all relevant planeDist on window resize (difficult if multiple cameras)
- Add textured objects (texture system, textures maybe as part of generic Object?)
- Use square of distance to check closest to save sqrt() call
- Add multithreading
- Don't include same inline functions in multiple files
- Fix black lines between some pixels when pixelSize > 1
- Add high DPI capability

### Partially Done:

- Make new file for world and make camera part of world class
- Properly clean up World objects on exit (I think I did it?)
- Optimize Plane::cast to not create new Point and Ray objects
- Fix issue of no shadows on line of x=0 (Maybe done?, probably not)
- Link SDL2 into application (see "macosx" [hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/docs/](http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/docs/))  OR  add Xcode files to github
- Add cube object
- Add movement controls
- Optimize things like [variable] = Point() to set all of the values to 0 instead of constructing a new object  (also Camera.move)

### Done:

- Make the plane cast actually get what axis it is on from the variable
- Figure out mouseX and mouseY polarity
- Restructure so that world object contains all objects to be cast
- Make use of Point object universal
- Fix shadows!
- Make use of Color objects universal
- Fix color issues caused by non-linear association of RGB values and brightness
- Finish camera.rotate and camera.getRay to make them actually work with rotation
- Find the required vectors for the camera when it is created
- Move this TODO list to a separate file
- Redefine operators and such to work with points(and rays?) (Operator overloading)
- Add shadows for plane.cast
- Transfer reflections(maybe more) to World.cast()
- Check if cstdint package is actually needed in world.cpp
- Avoid drawing spheres that are behind the camera
- Make window resizable
- Add reflections to all objects

### Maybe Do:

- Separate alpha from color object (not needed for some uses of Color)
- Add and impliment/use ray.length
- Optimize cross and dot products
- Find way not to trust passed width and height values (bad values could allow for overflow and potential security vulnerability)
- Move Color to new file
- Move color setting into world.cast (??)
- Change Ray objects to store a point and a vector instead of two points (still usint Point objects for both?)
- make Vector object (separate from Point object?) to distinguish between uses
